### About me
*My name is Sitora, but most people in the IT industry know me as Rikki Monti. Actually I am a medical student and programming is my hobby. Yes, I have chosen a great hobby for myself. I think my interest in programming stems from my love of computer games. After watching the Ready Player One movie, I set myself the goal of making a movie-based game like this in the future. My goal in learning programming was to create a game. But now I'm more focused on the full stack. One of the best things about me is that I never back down:)*

### Code

*[PHP]Implement a function which convert the given boolean value into its string representation. [root](https://www.codewars.com/kata/551b4501ac0447318f0009cd)*
```
function booleanToString($b) {
  if($b==true)
    return "true";
  else
    return "false";
}
```
*[PHP]The code provided is supposed replace all the dots . in the specified String str with dashes -But it's not working properly.  [root](https://www.codewars.com/kata/596c6eb85b0f515834000049)*
```
function replace_dots(string $str): string {
  return str_replace('.', '-', $str);
}
````
*[JavaScript]Mutual Recursion allows us to take the fun of regular recursion (where a function calls itself until a terminating condition) and apply it to multiple functions calling each other! Let's use the Hofstadter Female and Male sequences to demonstrate this technique. You'll want to create two functions F and M such that the following equations are true: [root](https://www.codewars.com/kata/53a1eac7e0afd3ad3300008b)*
```
function F(n) { 
if (n===0) return 1
return n - M(F(n - 1))
}

function M(n) { 
if (n===0) return 0
return n - F(M(n - 1))
}
```
